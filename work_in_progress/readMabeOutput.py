    '''
    Function for generating an activity matrices for the animats given outputs from mabe
    The issue is that in MABE the sensors are used to update the hidden nodes and motors within one output time step.
    To correctly analyze them in an information theoretical sense, sensors have to be shifted back by one time step compared to the other nodes.
    It is also important not to count transitions between trials as agent transitions, because the agents are reset at every trial

            data: a pandas object containing the mabe output from activity recording
